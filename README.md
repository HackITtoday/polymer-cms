# Polymer CMS with Firebase

This is a Content Management System built in Polymer. This is just an admin backend that can then be used for any projects. It pulls in information from Firebase and displays them in cards. Any information can be used and the UI stays the same. You can change the menu terms and references to anything you want.

It also has a authentication login system based on the firebase system.
